/* I wanted to have this "middleman", due to JS not supporting real decorators yet, to avoid boilerplate in the actual
* component/element class implementation. I insist on not using babels and some obscure pollyfills, to achieve decorator like effect,
* both of which require one quarter of npm dependencies to produce sub-par, bloated, unreadable cesspool of JS code in the end (let's
* not forget the .map.js files, which totally solve this and they are absolutely not clutter or an anti-pattern in this case), all to
* avoid having this meh-hack.
*
* Usage:
*
* Let's suppose you wanted to have a custom html element with a tag named "navigation". First you would have to define a new class, as such:
*
* class Navigation extends HTMLElement { // What a time we live in... JS has classes now, and COVID-19 is reducing us into 17th century plebs.
*       constructor() {
*           super(); // Yes, semicolons are super important!
*       }
* }
*
* Next, you would have to define this element, so the browser knows what you intended in the first place:
*
* customElements.define('navigation', Navigation); // This will execute the constructor of the Navigation class for each and every
* <navigation> element in your html (past, present and future)
*
*
* But then you also have to include some CSS and render a template...
*
* class Navigation extends HTMLElement {
*       constructor() {
*           super(); // Yes, semicolons are still important
*           const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' }), // For instance
*               style = document.createElement('style'),
*               template = '<div><p>Some text in my awesome component</p></div>',
*               someElement = document.createElement('some');
*
*           style.textContent = '\/* a bunch of css... that gets inserted into every single instance of this component class... neat, possibly a single large css or generated poop from a scss file *\/';
*           shadowRoot.append(style);
*           shadowRoot.append(someElement);
*           // or
*           this.innerHTML = template; // Or some other way
*           shadowRoot.append(style);
*       }
* }
*
* This way each instance gets it's own style tag with possibly more CSS that it needs and templates are a part of the class, which might
* sound convenient but is really not.
*
* What we want is an Angular like component, but done in the spirit of WebComponents API and not some über hack that downloads everyone's
* JavaScript from npm, needs Webpack and NodeJS to work and works through TypeScript and and and is mangled beyond anything you could call
* JavaScript any more (you can always go back to 90' and start writing Java Swing components if you really are a masochist). oh, and if you
* are using Angular for your 5 users a month page, don't do it the pleb way, use ramda to write an if/else with no less than 5 functions!
* (to authors of ramda: it's awesome, it really is, but users often do things that are irrational... borderline insane even)
*
* Component class will solve some of these problems for you. Each class that extends Component, should expose these four static (must be
* static) members:
*
* 1. tagName - the name of the tag
* 2. template - path to the template, without the html extension, which Component expects!
* 3. stylesheets - a *list* of css you want this component to use
* 4. registerComponents - a *list* of component classes that will be used in the context of this component
* 5. observedAttributes - a mapping (dict) of attributes you wish to watch for changes on this component
*
*
* ---tagName---
* This one is simple; if you want to associate your component with the tag <tag> then you should set template member to 'tag'
*
*
* ---template---
* This one might not be simple, but let's try. Each component can use an html file (it doesn't have to, though!) that will serve as the
* template for the innards of the component. If you don't like the paths, feel free to configure them via App settings. But in essence, all
* you have to do is create the template file in the right folder, as such:
*
* /media
*   /js
*       /sablono
*           /fiu
*               ...files
*           /components
*               ...files
*           /domain
*               tag.js (class that extends Component)
*   my-app-file.js
*   conf-file-you-were-looking-for-but-doesnt-exist.js
*   conf-file-for-something-else-you-were-looking-for-but-doesnt-exist.js
*   conf-file-for-something-that-will-make-your-app-super-slow-you-were-looking-for-but-doesnt-exist.js
*   /css
*       /sablono
*           reset.css
*           /domain
*               tag.css
*   /templates
*       /sablono
*           /components
*               ...files
*           /domain
*               tag.html <----- this is the template (if you keep the default folder structure, which you don't need to do)
*
* In such scenario, you would set template member to 'domain/tag' (no .html necessary, as this extension is not negotiable, we don't want
* to preprocess anything!).
*
* VERY IMPORTANT: If you wish to handle your templates on your own, just don't declare this member or set it to a falsy value.
*
* ---stylesheets---
* If we arrived this far, we are familiar with the folder structure at least a bit, in which case this one's easy as well. This functions
* very much like the template, except it's a list, which means you can include more than one css file for one component (which makes sense).
*
* VERY IMPORTANT: If you wish to handle your stylesheets on your own, just don't declare this member or set it to a falsy value.
*
* ---registerComponents---
* This is just a simple list of classes (classes, not strings, like names of classes or class instances, class objects) of the components
* that you want to be loaded when this Component instance is set up (think: child components). This cascades (A registers B which registers
* C that registers D and from here on you are probably just complicating) and it probably is smart to let this cascade, so you don't
* actually add clutter instead of removing it. With this simple trick, we totally and completely avoid modules and a ton of configuration.
*
* VERY IMPORTANT: If you wish to register your components on your own, just don't declare this member or set it to a falsy value.
*
*
* ---observedAttributes--- TODO: finish
* This is a convenient way to attach mutation observers for attributes through a simple dictionary. Think two-way-binding.
*
*
* Why jump through all of these hoops? Well, templates are still more or less a matter of choice on how to use them, we just provided a
* convenient way to do it, but css files can be a problem; most tutorials on the internets suggest you include your styles into the
* component like in the example at the top, but that's ok for some demo component that uses 5 lines of CSS and even if there are 100
* instances of such component on your page it will not pose any real problem. But should your css be some legacy or some compiled sass
* file, you would feel the burn even if you had only 10 instances.
*
* What sablono does is use adoptedStyleSheets for each shadowRoot, so in reality only one instance of the StyleSheet is really loaded at
* once and then shared among all components that need it, so you could still use a large file, even though I strongly advise against that.
* I like what Angular is trying to do, except I really dislike how they do it... Could be worse though: some advise using some css selectors
* that either don't work or will not work in the near future. Maybe it's the spec that could use some more work?
*
* So... in the end, you would end with the folder structure mentioned at the "template" section and a class looking like this:
*
* import { Component } from './sablono/fiu/component.js';
*
* export class TagComponent extends Component {
* 	static tagName = 'tag';
* 	static template = 'domain/tag';
* 	static stylesheets = [
* 		'reset',
* 		'domain/tag',
* 	];
*
* 	constructor(params) { // For params, see sablono/fiu/router.js
* 		super(TagComponent);  // This is the price you pay to avoid carfuffle of dealing with styles and templates
*       // Your code here
* 	}
* }
*/

	* {
