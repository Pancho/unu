/*
* Modelled after Navigo, no shame. For inspiration, see https://github.com/krasimir/navigo
*
* I chose Navigo as an inspiration because it is simple. Really simple; one file, JS code (and it's pretty at that), no complications.
* I did however rewrite good chunks of code, removed what I don't want to use, made it something I would like to use (renamed properties),
* but in no way will I deny credits to the original author even if it's hard to tell at this point.
*
* Usage of router requires you to specify a couple of things, and it's not self evident which and how.
*
* ---routeRoot---
* This is the leading part of the urls that should be ignored when handling urls with this router. Let's suppose we have our page hosted on
* a domain www.example.com and we are building our app from /admin forward. In this case routeRoot would be set to
* https://www.example.com/admin (no trailing slash). You would have to configure your web server (nginx or apache) to serve the same html
* file for all urls with /admin as the leading part (this is very important) as some users will certainly not start their navigation at
* that exact root. Root is then subtracted from any url to get only the part that this router handler will handle.
* Difference from Navigo is that in no way do I want to be guessing the root - set it OR hack this file.
*
* ---homePage--- and ---notFound---
* I'm grouping these two parameters together, because they are somewhat related. The homePage is the handler blob for the exact root url (/)
* and notFound for those that you did not specify (think 404, and 500 is not really needed as each component can take care of that on its
* own). Each of those provides only two other properties, like so:
*
* specialBlob = {
*   component: MyGreatComponent,
*   hooks: { // Totally optional, see "hooks" for more info on when, how any why each fires
*       before: () => {},
*       after: () => {},
*       already: () => {},
*       leave: () => {},
*   }
* }
*
* should you want to add some guards for these two, just add the invocation to the before hook (for others it's automatic, should a guard
* be specified).
* I diverged from Navigo here in a way where I don't want to have the same code handling the home, regular and not found routes. Home and
* not found are special cases and most frameworks agree, so I separated them. Navigo separates not found too, but I wanted to have all of
* the special cases handled in a similar way, not a mix of both worlds (I still think Navigo is great).
*
* ---defaultPageName---
* I'm skipping routes at this point, as they need far more explanation and am resorting to the defaultPageName now. This is the window.name
* parameter. window.name is the thing you usually put into the "target" attribute (remember: target="_blank", but it can also be
* target="Admin page"). To change this, just provide "name" attribute to an element with the "route" attribute and when one navigates via
* that attribute, window.name will also change. This is totally optional, and should be set to null or some other falsy value if you want
* it omitted.
*
* ---routes---
* This is the meat of this class even though we already touched this with homePage and notFound. In essence, it's a list of blobs, but these
* blobs must have a certain structure for router to work (duh), so let's start with a full example and we'll dissect it like a frog in a
* biology class:
*
* ...
* },
* {
*   path: '/main',
*	component: MainComponent,
*   hooks: {
*       before: (done, params) => {}, // This gets executed before we load this component (for instance to check permissions, default will do exactly that)
*       after: (params) => {}, // This gets executed after your component is loaded (not necessarily rendered though, that depends on the component)
*       already: (params) => {}, // This gets executed if one requests this route again (so it doesn't do anything but call this hook, should you need to cover that scenario)
*       leave: (params) => {}, // This gets called after one requests new route (like onbeforeunload, but not exactly like that) and unloads this one
*   }
* },
* {
* ...
*
* --params--
* Parameters are the urls variables, since we don't want to rely only on GET parameters (but you still totally can if you please), so we'll
* take time to explain how to craft url patterns here as well. In the example we set path to '/main', but if we want to use parts of the
* path to carry parameter data, we simply do it with colons, like so:
*
* path: '/main/:param1/something/:param2/also-something'
*
* With such url, your component will receive two parameters, called param1 and param2, both of which will be strings, so you will have to
* parse and cast to desired types. Why not do some casting automatically? We could, but that would trully make this a package worthy of its
* own name, and this is not our goal. Mostly you pass params that are meant to be either strings or numbers, so no casting should pose any
* problems.
*
* I also wanted to prevent the router from working with urls that use underscores or some other inferior convention, but hell, I will not
* forsake simplicity to prevent sloppiness. Same goes for param naming convention. Please try to use hyphens for urls (drastically
* increases url readability, even google recommends this: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/76329?hl=en) and camelCase
* convention for naming your parameters (you're writing JS not Python)
*
* While hooks are optional and pretty simple to understand, I need to stress that component must extend Component class (from
* sablono/fiu/component.js) and follow the convention or unexpected things may happen. It might be so that this could work without that
* class in between, but I did not spend a second trying that scenario out, and most likely will not.
* Do not try to make a path like '' or '/', because those (ot that) are a special case called homePage and are reserved for that.
